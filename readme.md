## Guides

### Generating/Updating Docs

To generate or update the documentation, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have `jsdoc` installed globally by running the following command:
   `npm install -g jsdoc`
2. Fully delete the `Docs` folder in the project. This is to generate a fresh documentation folder.
3. At the base project folder (blitzbuyr), run the following command:
   `jsdoc -c jsdoc.json`
   This will generate the documentation based on the JSDoc comments in the code.

To check the generated documentation, simply type `localhost` in your browser, which will take you to the documentation landing page.

Feel free check the [JSDoc main page](https://jsdoc.app) for more reference and guides on how to use JSDoc.

### Unit Testing

Unit testing is done with Mocha and Chai for the backend, and Jest for the frontend. Check their respective test folders in the Backend and Frontend directories. Refer to [Frontend Unit Tests](https://github.com/NaveFlactem/BlitzBuyr/tree/Testing-Branch/Frontend/tests) and [Backend Unit Tests](https://github.com/NaveFlactem/BlitzBuyr/tree/Testing-Branch/Backend/test) for reference on the existing tests and how to write additional tests.
